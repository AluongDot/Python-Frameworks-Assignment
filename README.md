# Python Frameworks Assignment

A short, well-organized README for the **Python-Frameworks-Assignment** repository (CORD-19 analysis notebook, visualization assets, and a small app). Repository contents include a Jupyter analysis notebook, cleaned CSV data, visualization images, and a simple application script. ([GitHub][1])

## Project overview

This repository analyzes the CORD-19 dataset and produces visualizations summarizing trends (e.g., papers by year, top journals, word frequency). It also contains a small local app (app.py) intended to present findings or visualizations interactively. The analysis is implemented primarily as a Jupyter notebook and Python scripts. ([GitHub][1])

## Requirements

Recommended (typical for this kind of project):

* Python 3.9+
* Jupyter (or Jupyter Lab)
* pandas, numpy
* matplotlib and/or seaborn (visualizations)
* plotly (optional, if interactive charts are used)
* streamlit or flask (only if `app.py` is built for one of these frameworks)

> If the repo contains a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`, prefer to use that. If not, the list above covers what you’re likely to need.

---

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AluongDot/Python-Frameworks-Assignment.git
cd Python-Frameworks-Assignment
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies (if repository provides `requirements.txt`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If no `requirements.txt` is present, install the common packages:

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
# and (if you want to run the app)
pip install streamlit flask
```

---

## Usage

### 1) Explore the analysis notebook

Start Jupyter and open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook CORD19_Analysis.ipynb
```

Run cells to reproduce the cleaning, analysis and visualization steps.

### 2) View generated visualizations

Open the images in `visualizations/` (PNG files are included to quickly inspect key charts without re-running the notebook).

### 3) Run the app

`app.py` is included to present findings interactively. Depending on how `app.py` was implemented, run it using one of the common methods:

* If it’s a Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* If it’s a Flask/Django/other Python script:

```bash
python app.py
# or follow the instructions in the file header (if any)
```

> If unsure, open `app.py` and check its imports — look for `import streamlit as st` (Streamlit) or `from flask import Flask` (Flask) and use the corresponding run method.

---

## Files of interest

* `CORD19_Analysis.ipynb` — main analysis notebook: data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization. ([GitHub][1])
* `cleaned_metadata.csv` — preprocessed dataset used in the notebook. ([GitHub][1])
* `visualizations/` — contains PNG charts created from the analysis (quick preview). ([GitHub][1])
* `app.py` — small app for visualizing or sharing results (check its header or imports to see how to run it). ([GitHub][2])

---

## Notes & suggestions

* Add a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` to make installation reproducible. Example generator:

  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
* Add a short description and keywords to the repository settings to make the project easier to find.
* If you want, I can:

  * create a ready `requirements.txt` after inspecting the code, or
  * produce a short `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidelines,
  * or generate a cleaned, polished `README.md` file and open a PR — tell me which you prefer.

# Python Frameworks Assignment

This repository contains an analysis of the CORD-19 dataset including a Jupyter notebook, cleaned metadata CSV, visualization images, and a small app for presenting results.

## Contents
- `CORD19_Analysis.ipynb` — notebook with data cleaning, exploration and visualizations  
- `cleaned_metadata.csv` — cleaned dataset used by the notebook  
- `app.py` — small application to present charts/results (check imports to see if it's Streamlit or Flask)  
- `visualizations/` — PNG visualizations generated by the notebook

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AluongDot/Python-Frameworks-Assignment.git
cd Python-Frameworks-Assignment
python -m venv venv
# activate venv
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if present
# or:
pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
````

## Running

* Notebook: `jupyter notebook CORD19_Analysis.ipynb`
* App (if Streamlit): `streamlit run app.py`
* App (if Flask): `python app.py`

## License

Add a LICENSE file (e.g., MIT) if you want this project to be open-source.

Would you like me to:
1. Create that `README.md` file and provide it here (copy-ready)?  
2. Inspect `app.py` and `CORD19_Analysis.ipynb` to auto-generate an exact `requirements.txt` and a `run` instruction tailored to what's actually imported?  
3. Open a pull request on your repository adding README (if you give me write access or fork permission)?

Pick one and I’ll do it now.
